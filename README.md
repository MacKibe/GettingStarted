Welcome to Mutall Data, here is a documentation on how to install all softwares and tools we use in our daily programming, and how to configure them.  
I will take you through a detailed guideline on how to correctly install all the programs on your system.

Let's start with browsers, we recommend having two or more browsers to carry out your web tests, the browsers are Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Edge, and others..

By default windows users have Microsoft Edge already installed.

### 1. Installing Google Chrome.

- Go to the Google Chrome download page [click here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- Click on the "Download Chrome" button.
- Select the correct version of chrome according to your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
- After the download is complete, navigate to the download folder and double-click on the Chrome setup file.
- A user prompt may appear, asking for permission to make changes to your device. Click "Yes" to continue.
- The Chrome installer will now begin. Click "Next" to proceed.
- The installer will ask if you want to "Make Google Chrome the default browser."
- If you want Chrome to be your default browser, click the checkbox next to this option. If not, leave it unchecked.
- Click "Install" to begin the installation process.
- Wait for the installation to complete. It may take a few minutes.
- Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to "Launch Google Chrome." If you want to start using Chrome right away, click the "Launch" button.  
  If not, you can launch Chrome later by finding it in your Start menu or by searching for it in Windows.

### 2. Installing Mozilla Firefox.

- Go to the Mozilla Firefox download page (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- Click on the "Download now" button to begin the download.
- Once the download is complete, navigate to the download folder and open the Firefox setup file.
- The Firefox installer will now begin. Click "Next" to proceed.
- The installer will ask if you want to "Customize Firefox." If you want to customize your Firefox installation,  
  click on the "Customize" button to select additional options, such as language and browser data import. If you  
  want to install Firefox with the default settings, click "Next."
- Click "Install" to begin the installation process.
- Wait for the installation to complete. It may take a few minutes.
- Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to "Launch Firefox." If you want to start using  
  Firefox right away, click the "Launch" button.  
  If not, you can launch Firefox later by finding it in your  
  Start menu or by searching for it in Windows.

Now that we have our browsers set up, let’s start downloading and instaling our programs.
